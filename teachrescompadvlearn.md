Without giving too much away - and it should be evident from the title - this book is for the teaching of particular computing skills for researchers that are primarily in non-computer science fields. It is borne from many years of experience in teaching computing to postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers to a number of institutions across Australia and can be accompanied by a number of books also recently published which derive their content from those classes. These publications include: Supercomputing with Linux, Sequential and Parallel Programming, Mathematical Applications and Programming, and Software Tools for eResearchers. A great deal of the motivation for writing this book comes from the need to 'teach the teachers', for as many a computer science student will affirm, those who have excellent technical knowledge are not necessarily those who have excellent educational knowledge. This is by no means a slight on their part, but rather simply a recognition that they are different skillsets, and one does not imply the other.

Another motivation in writing the publication is being witness to the negative effects of the improvements in computer interfaces since the early 1990s. Whilst there can be little doubt in the gains in providing intuitive user interfaces in simplifying a number of tasks and by lowering the knowledge requirements to actually engage in computer operations, there has been a loss in the general level of understanding among computer users. Those who were raised with the command-line as the primary interface have a better understanding of file system hierarchies and often operating system components, than those who have only gone to such levels under duress. The problem becomes evident however where, under circumstances where they have massive data processing needs, that high performance computation is required and the necessary skills.

Many authors are often at pains to avoid expressing moral judgements in their works and seek to remain as objective as possible. Whilst objectivity is very much a laudable goal, taking ethical positions themselves is by no means a matter of conflict. Indeed, in terms of evaluation it is clear that they are incommensurable. Facts may provide the resources for ethical positions, but they cannot determine them. Ethical positions require a grounding in evidence in order to be effective, but cannot determine the evidence. The pragmatic combination of two - what the ancient Hellenes called phronesis - combines both resources in a manner that results in prudent action. Thus, rather than being "just" factual, this publication finds inspiration from educational philophers whose commitment is towards an informed democratic participation and can include figures such as John Dewey, JÃ¼rgen Habermas, and the emancipatory orientations of Paulo Freire. In terms of developmental psychology and education, primary influences are Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, and Malcolm Knowles. On a related topic one other matter than must be mentioned as part of an democratic educational philosophy is a commitment to open-source knowledge. This commitment is based on the premise that research is best conducted when it is available for peer review. 

Knowing how to use a computer is the equivalent of literacy of our age, and knowing how to use it with a higher degree of competency is essential for researchers. Those who do not have these skills are at a distinct disadvantage. They cannot navigate to the extensive sources of knowledge available online, they cannot access the enormous data stores, they cannot process that data to make new discoveries. Certainly such individuals may also be protected from the rapid distribution of hyperbolic false information that appeals to confirmation and selective biases. But it is even more possible that in the connected enviroment that individuals will encounter those who have contrary views and information. Depending on their disposition they may even change their opinions when provided new evidence, which is certainly a prequisite for a genuine learner. Whilst people may learn from confirmation of their existing presumptions, but even more so from the intellectual humility to recognise their own ignorance on a subject. Reading a number of online 'discussions', one does wonder of the relative distribution of the two.

Of course, before this happens the user must have the access to the systems and competency in their use. Whilst the former is beyond the scope of this book, being more of a subject for sociologists and economists, the latter is the central issue here of which there are several components. Firstly, there is the question of what competencies are to be imparted, starting from the high-level discipline and then into the subdisciplines and components. Much of this is outside of the control of the educator themselves and depends more on the social needs of the learner and the determinations of the institution which the teaching is being conducted. The first chapter of this publication will initially discuss this in in some detail, as it also determines the disciplinary competencies and processes that the educator should concentrate on. After all, in order to impart knowledge the educator must have the knowledge themselves, notwithstanding the specific skills for education, or the new knowledge that can be gained in the process of conducting education.

The second chapter discusses the audience that an educator is involved with. The reality is that different learners are have differing levels of experience and different levels of cognitive development. In one sense, nearly all educators realise that it is simply not possible to apply the same content to different levels of experience; one does not use the same content in a programming course to upper primary school students as they would to post-graduate researchers. This much is obvious - what is much more surprising is that some educators seem to think that the same approach can be used in such divergent audiences. In this manner the conceptus of the pedagogy-andragogy continuum is illustrated, and the particular characteristics of adult learners, and especially advanced adult learners. Even if they have the same structures of cognitive development, the post-doctoral researcher is a different learner to the first-year undergratuate. In a different manner, the educator needs to be sensitive to the different experiences and meanings that a learner has based on the intersectional diversities of cultural, religious, gender, and class backgrounds. Understanding how to to harness these experiences in a constructive manner can further aid the learner by appealing to core issues of their social identity.
 
With the context and audience largely identified, the educator can then develop and emphasise appropriate content. The first step of this process is really establishing the learning objectives of the content, which itself is often part of the jigsaw of a wider programme or degree, which also indicates the prerequisites, if any, of the educational package. Any outcomes can then be used as prerequisites for other training packages. Within each training package however there needs to be structure to the content. This certainly does not mean that there is provisioning of style headings in a document, as one rather unfortunate bureaucrat in search of meaningful employment once tried to suggest (OK, granted that helps). Rather structured content, in an educational sense, is the application of input prequisites and output competencies within the learning module itself. If all of this sounds like procedural programming and the passing of parameters that's certainly because there is a high degree of similarity!

In addition to learning objectives and structure, the content itself also requires to be attentive to learning proximity. What is meant by this is the (originally) pedagogical theory of Lev Vygtotsky, who argued that for a particular compentency between independent competence and incompetence, there is a area ("the zone of proximal development") where a learner can engage with a task where they have an assistant or guide to help them through the process. It is in this zone that content should be primarily developed and where the teacher can provide the most practical assistance. Beyond this, there is the question of provisioning of the content. That is, what content should be provided and where. This may come with institutional restrictions, but in terms of general educational benefits free and open provisioning is explored. 

After developing the core content, there is the matter of delivery. In an environment where there is face-to-face interaction with a teacher, this will almost invariably lead to the introduction ad-hoc content, especially in an advanced andragogical audience. Nevertheless this does not diminish the need for detailed lesson plans.  With these in place, a particularly disciplinary learning style should be adopted. There has been a lot of justified criticism of the suggestion of individual learning styles, however there is empirical evidence that learning styles do have influence according to the subject matter. In the field of computer education, the principles of "yield to the hands-on imperative" (as the famous 'Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution" put it) and paired-programming, provide a useful foundation. These contribute to constructivism, the educational theory from Jean Piaget that people generate knowledge and meaning from the interaction between their abstract ideas and concrete experiences, and constructionism, Seymour Papert's argument that learners construct intellectual models in the pursuit of understanding their experiences and the ideas provided to them. In this particular discipline, much is to be gained from the new 'connectivist' approaches to content delivery, inspired by contemporary social media technologies.

After delivery of a learning package assessment and revision is absolutely essential. Obviously, there should be some form of assessment of the learner's as well. However in an advanced andragogical environment, traditional forms of assessment are not particularly well suited.  Alternatives which are based on actual use of the material are far superior for this particular audience. With regards to revision, nobody's teaching material is perfect, least of all this publication, and nobody's delivery is perfect either. One should always seek to improve and update their material. This includes the actual content itself, the delivery, and the facilities where the teaching is conducted. It is argued that the first body of opinion generation should come from the learners themselves. 

The content of this book is largely derived from the experience of training postgraduate researchers through the Victorian Partnership for Advanced Computing. These classes were designed to provide the necessary skills for such learners to utilse the Linux operating system effectvely (navigation, shell scripting, Python scripting), use various batch-system job submissions tools for high performance compute clusters (TORQUE, PBSPro, OpenPBS, write parallel programs (OpenMPI), use mathematical programming languages (R, Octave), and database systems (PostgreSQL), along with training courses for system administrators in managing their job schedulers, resource managers, distributed compute management tools (xCAT), monitoring systems (Ganglia, Nagios), and compiling various scientific software applications. 

Such training was carried out over a number of institutions including: the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, La Trobe University, the University of Melbourne, Deakin University, Swinburne University, Victoria University of Technology, the University of Sydney, Macquarie University, the University of New South Wales, the University of Western Australia, the Australian Institute of Health Innovation, the Westmead Millennium Institute, and the Australian Institution of Marine Science. Prior I also had experience training staff in general computer systems at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in Timor-Leste, and several years training the electorate office staff at the Parliament of Victoriatraining electoral roll database systems.

One of the significant challenges for this book was to make it generic enough so it could be applied for a range of computer technologies but also practical enough so that a computer science educator would not be bogged down in just theory, fascinating enough as it is. Hopefully one of the main aspects of advanced education - that is to provide theoretically grounded practical skills - has been delivered, albeit only in this particular format. The publication is partially supplemented from a variety of papers and presentations from the author to a number of eResearch educational conferences and other similar groups over the past several years, but more directly from over a thousand hours of classes to researchers over the past eight years. It was their feedback and enthusiasm that provided the greatest motivation for publication.

# 1.0 Context

## 1.1 The Knowledge Economy

It may seem strange to begin a book on adult education and research computing with an excursis into the field of theoretical macroeconomics, but nevertheless it is grounded in practical intent. Before one engages in teaching, the question must be asked 'what is this teaching for?' and whilst the trite answer 'because there is a demand for it', is satisfactory from a producer-consumer relationship, the wider implications ("externalities") must also be addressed. Transactions, including the transfer of knowledge and skills, have additional effects on others who are not part of that transaction. 

In the past several decades it has been fashionable to discuss individual and aggregate knowledge and skills in terms of human capital. The OECD has defined human capital as follows:

"The knowledge, skills, competencies and attributes embodied in individuals that facilitate the creation of personal, social and economic well-being" (OCED, 'The Well Being of Nations', 2011).

In this sense, education and training is seen as an 'investment' in the learner, which supplements their innate qualities and other environmental factors, and one which should have the outcomes of higher earnings, productivity gains, individual satisfaction, and social integration. The latter point is an excellent example of positive externlities. Additional participation in education has been shown to correlate with a diverse range of benefits including better health outcomes, reduced risk of smoking, reduced criminal involvement, and higher participation in community groups (OECD, op cit). These correlations are certainly not reducible to cognitive ability alone. 

Variations in individual earnings are partially explicible by human capital investments as well. The Interantional Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) accounted for some 40% of variation in individual earnings through measures such as education, literacy and work experience, parental educational attainment, and so forth. Interestingly of course is that some 60% can not be attributed to such factors. 

In a model of perfect competition, wages are determined by productivity. However labour markets do not operate in perfect competition; in most cases they are monopsonistic, that is, there are more potential employees than employers, giving market power to the latter group. In addition there is conscious and unconscious discrimination by employers according to social categories; bordering on the bizarre women orchestra players have been traditionally underrepresented with a range of excuses provided concerning competence. When 'blind auditions' where conducted the likelihood of female selection increased by sevenfold (Marilyn Marks, Blind auditions key to hiring musicians, Princeton Weekly Bulletin, Feb 12, 2001 http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/01/0212/7b.shtml). Nevertheless, it is clear that education and training does have positive individual and social outcomes. 

There is also a semantic and category debate as well. In political economy, capital is what is owned by capitalists, from which they receive an income return from. It is machinery part of the factors of production, distinct from natural resources and labour. The confusion between material capital and considering human beings as capital by which they can be invested in and owned, can lead to something akin to slavery:

"The counterpart for education would be to 'buy' a share in an individual's earning prospects: to advance him the funds needed to finance his training on condition that he agree to pay the lender a specified fraction of his future earnings. In this way, a lender would get back more than his initial investment from relatively successful individuals, which would compensate for the failure to recoup his original investment from the unsuccessful. There seems no legal obstacle to private contracts of this kind, even though they are economically equivalent to the purchase of a share in an individual's earning capacity and thus to partial slavery."
(Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom, 1962)

In classic political economy, the primary factors of production were land (i.e., all natural resources), labour, and capital. Capital represents durable goods that are used in production of goods or services. It contrasts with the accounting definition of "capital" which refers to stocks, shares, currency etc representing the perceived exchange value of such durable goods. There is a belief that political economy did not include "intangibles", such as organisation efficiencies, individual entrepreneurship, consumer goodwill, or skills and knowledge. This isn't quite true, as there was recognition for example, of "labour power", the variable capacity of each additional unit to the productive process, or likewise the productivity of machinery, or the from various grades of land (from Ricardo).

Nevertheless the perception of this alleged lack has led to a proliferation of capital theory. Today there is volumes of material describing "human capital" (i.e., skills and knowledges), "social capital" (networks of trust), "intellectual capital" (intellectual property), "natural capital" (the environment), even "cultural capital" (particular aesthetic tastes) and so forth. How long will it be until someone produces a treatise of "capital capital"? 

Whilst one could engage in a metaphor of investing in knowledge and skills (i.e., education and training) to produce utility ("well being") and that these knowledge and skills may depreciatate, and could be subject to "capital flight" as 'owners' of the human capital depart for places that offer better wages. If the metaphor is followed further perhaps "attributes" could be considered something closer to "human land" instead, although it should be pointed out that neoclassical economics tends to, incorrectly in my view, conflate land and capital. Indeed arguably, the discussion of "human capital" does look like an attempt to convert labour, as a factor production, into capital as well. Apparently everything is capital now!

From the outset it seems that the term "human capital" is not really the right one, as it does not share the definitional characteristics of "capital" in an economic sense, and nore does it share the ownership relations. The same can be said for the other It would be better to call investment in labour what it actually is - and remove an potential ambiguity that the owner of skills and knowledges (and attributes and motivations), is the individual where they are actually located. Where such terms are encountered, it is more useful to think of "training and education" for the 
purpose of improving potential well-being.

The term "potential" is used carfully. Phillip Brown (P. Brown, 'The Opportunity Trap: Education and Employment ina Global Economy', European Education Research Journal, Vol 2:1, 2003, p141-179) explictly takes issues with the claims from the OECD with the claims that investment in education provides "opportunity, prosperity[,] and justice", specifically arguing that "social inequalities in the competition for a livelihood and an intensification of 'positional' conflict". Everyone must engage in this rush for positional advantage in order to maintain their current standard of living. We "have to run faster, for longer, just to stand still". This is "the opportunity trap". 

The argument elaborates both prior symptoms of the "diploma disease" and uses the core insights of the sociology of education as elucidated by Durkheim (i.e., the socialisation role, and the selection role), and Weber (rationalisation of society, complexity). There are claims that the new professions generated by technical complexity will "generate new opportunities for jobs that offer excitement, creative fulfillment, and personal development. Work is the new consumption." From a conflict perspective however, "The expansion of higher education is not believed to reflect changes in the demand for high-skilled workers, but credential inflation ... The idea of credential inflation is similar to monetary inflation".

There is a degree of truth in these remarks, but much of it is explicible in terms of classical analysis of class conflict but also recognising the complexity of labour. The correlation between education, productivity, and general wealth should not be denied. Additional complexity also means additional specialist skills which narrows the traditional monopsonistic labour markets. There is, as mentioned, significant externalilities derived from population with higher education levels. Thus, whilst the insights of a conflict theory and an opportunity trap are recognised as providing insight, they are not entirely accepted in terms of substance. To the educator, this surely brings some relief - it is still useful on a social level to provide advanced skills. 

Such an analysis takes issue with Brown's claim that: "If in the future everyone had a PhD or the like, then these advanced degrees would be worth no more than a job in a fast food restaurant." If we engage in such a though experiment it would be quickly realised that a society where everyone is a post-doctoral (or equivalent) graduate would not only be a pleasant society to be in, but it would also have enormous increases in overall productivity through the implementation of (a) new technologies that produce more for less and consumer goods that save time and energy, (b) new social organisation and legal norms with greater moral grounding and (c) aesthetic products that provide greater inspiration.

Another criticism of the knowledge economy approaches comes from Peter Robinson ('The Tyranny of League Tables: international comparisons of educational attainment and economic performance', in Robin Alexander, Patricia Broadbent, David Phillips (eds), Learning from Comparing Volume I : Contexts, Classrooms, and Outcomes, Symposium Books, 1999). This empirical study takes issue with the assumed correlation between educational attainment and economic performance. There is recognition that a high level enrolment of children in primary secondary education as a "necessary condition for poorer countries to reach a state of economic growtth which will allow them to converge with the living standards of the advanced industrial economies".

Beyond that level however the any supposed correlation is dubious. The evidence in advanced industrial countries linking mathematics attaintment with growth in GNP per capita is weak. There is no meaningful correlation at all with science attainment, and only a limited relationship with literacy. Indeed, once the initial eductional standards are reached there seems to be greater correlation with educational attainment and economic success where there is a higher level of income equality. In order to succeed the knowledge economy must be a distributed economy.

A significant portion of the argument from a conflict theory perspective is that the driver for learners in the knoweldge economy is individualistic and acquisitive, as opposed to cooperative and inquisitive. Indeed, it is almost a precondition for their argument. But this runs contrary to the nature to a great deal of advanced education, but in terms of the content and in the psychology of the learners. It is particularly pertinent in the field of research computing which depends very heavily on the provision and use of free and open source software. Doubtless most people in advanced research computing are hopeful that their skills shall provide a good income, but the very complexity of the work itself tends to be the cause of that income rather than some form of carefully guarded trade-secrets.

The two dichotomies however seem a little simplistic, as they overlook the possibility of not just a continuum, but rather a a multiplicity of simultaneous motivations that can occur in an individual educational decision. A person may, for example, be both sincerely interested in bioinformatics as well as motivated by the possibility of acquiring a stiff piece of carboard which allows them to use the letters "PhD" as a post-nominal. If these dichotomies are not a continuum, then what are they? Are they completely independent metrics or they dependencies? An initial consideration leans towards the latter, based merely on the observation of those who seem unduly influenced by external influence, validation, and acquisition. 

It is anecdotal evidence, but it the recollection of one group of summer research students at VPAC who displayed little interest in research computing as such, but had been encouraged by their parents to seek the path of a well-paying job that generates this consideration. They had adopted, or had been influenced, to take a path that provided material satisfaction without internal joy, and as such displayed the dissonance that results in taking up acquisitive goals without an intrinsic justification. Encountering such individuals is challenging for the eductor; effort needs to be made to generate the spark of enthusiasm and love of the subject matter but if the learners have on acquisitive goals, then it is difficult to see how they will provide the motivation necessary for advanced research.

## 1.2 The Adult Learner

Along the continuum, adult learners are different to child learners. The educator must be aware of their particular mental and social characteristics and adjust lesson plans, teaching style, and course content accordingly. The discipline of development psychology is extremely important in making the necessary adjustments. In particular one can derive importance from Sigmund Freud on psychosexual development, Jean Piaget in cognitive development, Lawrence Kohlberg on moral development, and George Herbert Mead on symbolic development. Following the neurological changes that correlate with the onset of puberty, a person gains the capacity to engage in formal operations on a cognitive level, post-conventional thinking in moral reasoning, recognition of the other in terms of the generalised other, and the adoption of roles.

These adult developments need to be placed in the context of the sequential paths in childhood development. In the field of cognitive structures, there is a progression from sensorimotor cognition, to the preoperational, concrete operational, to formal operations from adolescence onwards. Likewise in moral development, from again the sensorimotor, to preconventional, conventional, to post-conventional moral reasoning, in psychosexual development from instinct, to the id, ego, and superego, and in interactions from the instinctual to play, games, and the adoption of roles. Beyond this however there is the period of young adulthood where the capacity for such mental structures becomes a reality. Having the mental structures does not automatically imply the knowledge or experience to put this ability into practise. Typcially stabilisation of brain plasticity from myelination of the prefrontox cortex and the pruning of synatic clusters does not end, on average, until the mid-twenties. 

The distinction and continuum between child learners and adult learners is elaborated in the differences between pedagogy and andragogy. The former term is sufficiently well known, however the latter is reltively more recent. Although coined by German educator Alexander Kapp in 1833, who noted that the teaching of adults was different to the teaching of childen. The term fell into disuse until an appearance in the 1920s by  Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy again arguing for special requirements in adult education. Even after that it was not receiving much consideration in the English speaking world, even if it was being used in France, Holland, and Yugoslavia (Nottingham Andragogy Group (1983) Towards a Developmental Theory of Andragogy, Nottingham: University of Nottingham Department of Adult Education). It was not until the work of Malcolm Knowles (Knowles, M. S. (1968). Andragogy, not pedagogy. Adult Leadership, 16(10), 350-352, 386.)

There are several characteristics of adult learners that an educator must be aware of. Firstly, there is a principle of adult learners have different needs for learning. Whereas younger learners may find themselves in an educational institution for statutory reasons, the adult learner a wider range of reasons. Some have particular employment or non-vocational needs to attend, where the need is externally generated - rather like the younger learner. Older learners tend, however, to have more internally generated motivations, such as desiring to improve their skills, for their own ends. There is of course, always some overlap here. Few adult learners engage in learning entirely due to internal motivations alone, least of all due with considerations of socialisation. But at least the recognition of different needs is appropriate. As related eleboration is the difference in the lhe learner's self-concept. A child learner is typically well aware if their dependencies, as much as they may disapprove of them. The adult learner is likewise aware of the responsibilities that comes with independence. 

These conceptual and motivational differences correlate with differences in the learner's experience. As should be evident adult learners have a rich resource of experiences to draw upon as examples, almost invariably far greater that those of child learners. Adult learners likewise typically have taken these experiences and built existing frameworks of reality in which these experiences have been integrated. This can be, of course, positive or negative. An experienced learner may have deeply ingrained prejudices rather than deeply considered convictions as a result, and they can be more difficult to shift, especially in consideration of the relative equality of power in the learning environment between adult learners and their educators - it should not be unexpected that in some circumstances adult educators will be younger and less experienced that they people whom they are providing education to. An approach that uses the pedagogical educational authority is unlikely to have much resonance in such an environment.

As a result, the content must also differ.

Tanner, Arnett, and Leis (2009) make the claim that there is a need for the "unique developmental features of discrete age periods", specifically "the need to recognize the age period between 29 [sic: 19] and 30 as a distinct development period, emerging adulthood". The theory of 'emerging adulthood' was proposed by Arnett, initially in 2000, "to identify a new and distinct period of the life course that came to define the experience of 18- to 29-year-olds in industrialized societies over the past half-century". Assigning development stages to social contexts, Arnett argues that 18-29 year olds can no longer be described as "young adults", as they are unmarried, without children, and are not in stable full-time work. Nor is it possible to describe them as "adolescents" as they are not going through puberty, they are not in secondary school, and they do not live in their parent's home.

The theory of emerging adulthood claims that period will be associated with "1) the age of identity explorations, 2) the age of instability, 3) the self-focussed age, 4) the age of feeling in-between, and 5) the age of possibilities". Identity exploration was previously associated with adolescence (Erikson, 1950) however Arnett (et al) now argue that although romantic love is typically experienced in that period, it becomes identity focussed in emerging adulthood. Likewise, whilst adolescents are often in part-time work, the work becomes more identity focussed in emerging adulthood, etc. Surveys suggest that emerging adults consider themselves subjectively adults "in some ways yes, in some ways no", suggesting a period of transition. Possibilities are considered high with the opportunity to leave pathogenic family environments with the "change in the parent-child relationship ... recognized as one of the most important markers in becoming an adult".

Arnett's "string of social transitions" is complemented by Tanner (2006) who presents a three-stage process of a development process of individual recentering from adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood, which "[b]y definition ... is marked by a weakening of institutional ties". The proponents claim that "developmental science has progressed in its understanding of emerging adulthood as a critical period for the evolution of adult cognitive structures", further noting "significant differences between the adolescent and emerging adult brains", particularly brain maturation. With brain maturation, "intelligence as a genetically pre-disposed component of cognitive functioning becomes less salient during emerging adulthood and settled in experience becomes more salient", the claim of salience also repeated for emotional intelligence, concluding when "adulthood is achieved as a function of consolidation of identity around commitments to careers and families", albeit with a period of emerging adulthood representing a high-risk for psychiatric disorder. In terms of informal social networks, the authors do acknowledge however that emerging adults have similar friendships, with existing gender differences continuing. The chief exception appears to be a higher than average subjective claim of family members as close friends, correlating with the establishment of individual independence.

Despite initial implications of universality, the authors suggest that "[e]merging adulthood is culturally bound existing 'in contemporary industrialized cultures that extend the transition to adulthood until the mid- to late twenties'", especially with the "American college experience and college environment are well-suited to the development features of emerging adulthood". In such societies "[t]he boundary between childhood an adulthood is not as sharp as it used to be", with emerging adulthood bridging a supposed gap between to the two stages. For the authors, the implication of such a developmental stage is an opportunity for "tapping into their unique motivations for learning and development", noting "an openness to experience, an eagerness to try new things, and a willingness to learn".

Critique

The article by Tanner et.al., provides a compiled wealth of contemporary empirical references, but suffers for a want of epistemological rigour and clarity in interpretation. The initial concerns of how the proposal of "emerging adulthood" is initially implied as a developmental category, then redefined as culturally bound is an early example of this problem which the authors themselves noticed. Developmental psychology, of course, has historically sought universal features that can associate mental states with biological development. 

To represent a genuinely new developmental stage, rather than a deviation that will generate social pathologies (something which Tanner et. al., note a significant without explanation), new developmental features have to be illustrated. 


Tanner et.al., do illustrate the significance of brain maturation and cognitive stability. As significant at these are these are not however new categories themselves. As such, there is no new developmental category of "emerging adulthood", but rather a useful illustration of the gradual biological extension of young adulthood through the maturation process and where cognitive reasoning is part of that process. This should certainly be recognisable in education; contrary to Tanner et.al., many adolescents are certainly capable of being subject to the key concepts of the andragogical model, as illustrated by Burns, without or without institutional independence, but only after the acquisition of the capacity for formal operations, post-conventional moral reasoning, etc. What is quite interesting the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the so-called "emerging adulthood" age. This, at least from a perspective of critical sociology, suggests that there is a misalignment in the societies studied between the cognitive development and social integration. That certainly is an area requiring further research.

Reviewing the earlier post "Who Are You?" and considering those changes I would have to claim that 'who I am', in terms of substantive content, is a matter of continuous transition that most certainly cannot be narrowed down to a single developmental age group, real or imagined.

If I try to abstract it however into an interest in computational science, and an involvement in libertarian socialist politics, and an interest in the aesthetic of mythologies - which really has dominated my entire adult life experience and therefore must be considered major components of my identity - I must acknowledge that these came to the be in my early adolescence, around 12-13 in all three cases.

It is not a case of a single particular event (although there were events that correlate), but rather - in hindsight - the apparent ability to look at such matters with a different cognitive manner which simply didn't exist in childhood.
Introduction: Lifelong Learning

The idea of leaving school, studying or training for a particular career or job, and then remaining in that job for life, no longer holds true. The changing nature of the workplace, including widespread implementation of computerised systems, means that job descriptions are being continuously redefined. Increased opportunities for travel and leisure have led to a more mobile workforce with the time to develop recreational interests.

With changes such as these, there is increasing acknowledgment that education and training are not the exclusive province of school children and school leavers. Instead, it is generally accepted that learning is a lifelong process:

"Nowadays, it is widelyâif not universallyâacknowledged that formal education occupies only a small proportion of the learning continuum, that most people complete their formal education early in their lives in a relatively short period, and that most learning experiences take place outside the educational institution." Candy & Crebert (1990, pp 65â77)

The last pair of readings (Candy, Crebert, & OâLeary, 1994) for this topic stresses the importance of developing lifelong learners. The optional reading (Gonczi, 2004) also addresses the issue of lifelong learning and a learning society but in the context of vocational and professional education. The author is highly critical of reductionist approaches to competency-based education. He makes a case for the value of holistic, work-based learning opportunities that bring together the general and the vocational, the generic and the specific. Based on situated-learning theoretical perspectives, the author recommends that universities consider apprenticeship models for undergraduate education and postgraduate work-based learning degrees.














This topic examines the extent to which adult learners have unique characteristics, distinct from child learners. The two major characteristics of adult learning that emerge out of this literatureâwhich are inspired by humanistic principlesârelate to (1) autonomy of direction in learning and (2) the importance of the use of personal experience as a learning resource. Further distinctions can be made between adults as returning students in adult education, industry training programs, mature age learners in college or graduate school, and school leavers as young adults who have progressed straight through their training without involvement in the âreal world.â Finally, the unique characteristics and needs of some specific groups of adult learners can be identified.

The first reading (Tanner, Arnett & Leis, 2009) is a bit longer, and it is intended to be an introduction to one possible conception of the stages of adulthood. As you read, begin to think about how the needs of emerging adult students may differ (or be the same as) needs of children or needs of more mature adults.

The next reading for this topic (Burns, 1995) discusses a number of concepts and issues relating to adult learnersâincluding the concepts of andragogy and pedagogy. His paper is very comprehensive and covers a number of theoretical perspectives on adult learning, concluding with major principles of teaching adult learners and conditions for effective adult learning (pp. 251â252).

The third reading for this topic is presented âout of order.â The previous reading critiques andragogy. The current reading is from the author of the theory, Malcolm Knowles. In particular, this book chapter presents the evolving conception of the theory of andragogy from Knowles and his colleagues. Knowles (1984) proposed that adult learners had unique characteristics and needs, distinct from child learners, and therefore require totally different instructional approaches. He believed that the pedagogical model used in schools was unsuitable for adult learners and proposed an andragogical model based on his assumptions about the unique characteristics of adult learners.

Emerging Adulthood: Learning and Development During The First Stage of Adulthood

Summary


Short Answers

Lifelong learning is the interest. motivation, and increasingly the necessity, of the knowledge acquisition and reflection.

It is contextually relevant for adult learners who already have reached a level of education. It may occur in a formal, semi-formal, informal, or even autodidact setting.

"(1) What differencesâif anyâdo you see between adult learners and children learners?"

Whilst the differences between adult and child learners exist on a continuum and vary according to individuals concerned, some aggregate remarks can made, most of which can be discerned from the readings by Burns and Knowles et. al. In summary;

* Adults are usually in a voluntary learning environment, whereas children must attend school.
* Adult learning tends more towards self-motivated and independent learning with a greater range of experiental resources.
* Adult learning tends increasingly towards a research orientation rather than a teaching-training orientation.

The reasons for this change include chronological opportunities for life experience and development of social networks, the acquisition of legal rights, and neurological changes. The main ramifications is the need for educators to provide a learning environment that is more orientated to a greater level of equality between learner and educator, the opportunity to express knowledge from life experiences, and the flexibility to engage in study directions suited to their own practical tasks and interests.

As an adult learner in a variety of settings (formal, informal, personal) this matches with my own experience.

"(2) Why is LLL valuable in your life or in your studentsâ lives?"

As adult learner motivations vary the value of LLL will also vary. As an example, derived from the Burn's article, for some, it is a matter of a pure love of learning for its own sake. For others it about establishing social networks in an area of mutual interest. For other still, it is a necessary (and perhaps even unwelcome!) response to the rate of change on the vocational environment. In most cases the value will be a combination of all three.

    Please think of 3-5 non-traditional places where adult learning happens. Share these with your classmates.

Places where non-traditional adult learning can occur (assuming "traditional" means the university and other higher education setting) includes:

- Various online sources and specialist social media, but only those who make a serious effort to check primary sources, etc. Wikipedia, for example, as a starting point by following the references it uses. Google scholar is quite good as well.

- At work, through experience and discussion with colleagues.

- Conferences and meetings of organisations I'm involved in and casual conversation with friends; again however caution is expressed. Much of what people say in casual conversation needs to be checked. Conference presentations, at least of the more scholarly variety, tend to be somewhat better researched.

    Share your thoughts about the message being conveyed. Here are a few guiding questions:
    (1) What is the message?
    (2) Is this good or bad?
    (3) What are the assumptions about the current state of education and the proposed âfixâ?
    (4) What do students need to be able to succeed in the proposed environment? 

(1) What is the message?

The message is new and flexible approach to online education is more adaptable to unique student requirements.

(2) Is this good or bad?

The suggestion of greater flexibility and student control over their time and content is particularly beneficial in an increasingly asynchronous and unstructured social environment (whether that is a good thing is another matter entirely).

In terms of the learning presentation, it is not really something that can be determined from the material provided. Online education can and does work (speaking from someone who has completed "a few" post-graduate qualifications from online institutions), but it really does depend on the quality of the tools provided, the community, the individual learner, and the subject matter.

(3) What are the assumptions about the current state of education and the proposed âfixâ?

The assumption is the that most traditional education systems are rigid, especially in terms of functional needs (spatial proximity, timetables, etc); there is an implicit suggestion that traditional education methods are old-fashioned and the people who use them are herd-like.

(4) What do students need to be able to succeed in the proposed environment?

Data access technologies are a necessary requirement. Relevant skills at operating such technologies will also prove advantageous. Assuming technologies and skills, time management, motivation and interest of the student will be deciding factors.

    One of the activities in the internal session was to reflect on a good or bad teacher/teaching experience. Setting yourself in the role of supervisor, what type of evaluation would you write for this person, and how would you draw on the theories of the readings for Topic 1 to support your conclusions? 

As an overall statement, deriving from Burns (1995), an adult educator must relate to their students on a more equal basis. Where this is not the case Burns makes a point that "where responsibility is withheld, and where learners must fit into the structure ... [i]t is hardly surprising that adults approach formal settings with diffidence, low confidence and feelings of inferiority".

Following the recommendations of adult educational theory (andragogy), it is essential to differentiate the teaching methods from childhood educational theory (pedagogy), with the emphasis of the gradual introduction of adult teaching styles to those who have reached the appropriate level of cognitive maturity, operational ability, and moral reasoning.

In the particular example being considered greater attention can made towards the desire for adult learners to derive resources from their own experiences and that of their social network rather than the revealed knowledge of the educator, to present a focus on particular problems rather than a subject and prescribed curriculum, and to establish motivation from perfomance success rather than external critera (Burns op cit, p239).

The subject matter involves the introduction of new, disruptive, technologies into the workplace. Given the high level of unpredictability to an environment, course material can be more orientated towards the proposals for lifelong learning (Candy et al., 1994) and especially the need for lifelong learning for all adults. In the particular context it would have also been extremely useful to encourage collaborative workplace-based education (Gonczi, 2004).

    I am always curious what phrases catch people's attention.

    These two phrases caught my eye:

    Burns, pg 237 "as the new meanings and knowledge are digested into existing knowledge" -- a great metaphor for the influence of past experience on the assimilation of new information

    Gonczi, pg 27 "the mind as a holistic pattern detector" -- a great metaphor for the innate skills all students bring to the learning process...and, too often, a skill that is overlooked in the curriculum planning process.

    Please share any quotes from the readings that "spoke" to you as an adult educator and/or lifelong learner. 

Whilst I could find numerous references to the quote from Ãmile, when I actually checked the text (available in full at: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5427) it simply doesn't exist. Of course, it's scattered "all over the Internet", but at least Wikiquote notes that the attribution is, in fact, unsourced. (I do admit to a somewhat passionate distaste for false, misleading, and otherwise incorrect attributions. I have ranted about such things elsewhere c.f., http://lightbringers.net/node/16)

If we pretend however that Rousseau did make such a remark, and that he did so in Ãmile, there is another glaring difference between that quote and the reference to Knowles by Burns: Rousseau wrote Ãmile specifically for childhood education whereas the Knowles reference refers to adult education. It is not until Book V (Book VI is reserved for the education of girls and young women) that Ãmile enters his adolescent years and taught of the complexity of human emotions, is socialised - and is taught (for the first time) about religion.

Retaining the pretence, it makes great sense that Rousseau argues that the teacher retains control, whilst allows for the appearance of freedom. For it allows the child to learn through exploration, whilst retaining safe boundaries. They are effectively being *taught* freedom. Likewise, in reference to Knowles, it makes sense in an adult education environment that formal control is retained by the educator, even if they express this through informal techniques - as the students already have the responsibility of freedom. In both cases the activities are beneficial to the student.

Just a few semi-random thoughts on reading the STP:

* I am uncertain whether the experiences of "emerging adults" are integrated into "identities and memories more so than in any other age". There would be a few methodological issues with testing this to begin with!

* The challenge between adults as self-directing agents, and framing curriculum to their diverse interests is a very real one. In the Software Carpentry model (http://software-carpentry.org/) there is a deliberate attempt to bring people in from similar disciplines to encourage common interest, application, and collaboration.

* Learning style preferences can be accommodated through diversity in teaching presentation, class activities, and multimedia. This may result in repeating content, but certainly from the paper by Biggs (1986) on "Confucian-heritage learning culture", that repetition does not equate with rote-learning.

* The example of a student learning scales, some of which they have ability, and other where do not, is interesting in illustrating how emphasizing the former can be used for confidence building, and gradually introducing the latter provides scaffolding.








Lifelong learning is another concept that is often bandied about along with âknowledge economyâ and âinformation age.â In this week, we will review definitions of the concept, examine how it is embraced and developed in Australian social policy, and consider critical perspectives.

Learning objectives: Billett
1. What is lifelong learning, and how is it different than lifelong education?
2. How is learning done in educational settings different than learning done outside of them?
3. What are some of the ways in which the needs of learners conflicts with the need of educational institutions?

Learning objectives: Chapman et al
1. How is Australian social policy embracing and fostering lifelong learning?
2. What are the main challenges to encouraging lifelong learning in social policy?

Learning objectives: Olssen
1. Theory of governmentality: What is it? Who developed it?
2. What is âneoliberal flexibilizationâ?
3. How is lifelong learning a âtechnology of powerâ?
4. How can lifelong learning be safeguarded from âneoliberal appropriation?â

SL wrote: 13/. Billett (2010) argues for a clear distinction between learning and teaching, saying much learning happens outside of educational institutions, criticising those who unquestioningly assume the value of a taught course. As an educator of adults, how relevant to you is the learning that your students do outside of your course, your classroom or your teaching institution?

RHW responded: I'm also wondering if age/experience has to do with outside educaitonal institutional experiences and how these can influence a classroom - so many times a mature aged student has really brought so much to the classroom that one can't find in the books of theory. Practice is so important yet so less likely to valued as theory at university anyway. (week three readings touch on this a bit).

My reply: Age and experience has a great deal to with approaches towards lifelong learning and lifelong education. The inisghts of developmental psychology are certainly useful in that regard.

In summary form the following is acknowledged:

In general one can witness in mature-aged education greater levels of mutuality of responsibility between student and teacher, activities based on real needs and self-corcordant goals of the participants [1], higher levels participation, self-direction, teacherâs role as resource and facilitator, learnerâs experiences form the basis of learning, the need for an more open and democratic environment [2], and issues related to fluidity and crystallized intelligence [3], and future-time orientation [4].

Due to motivational differences that arise from their social and cognitive developmental stages the distinction between lifelong learning and lifelong education is probably going to be less significant from the perspective of the learner.

JA asked: Discussion point/Question 1): In the work from Billet (2010) there is the suggestion that lifelong learning is different to lifelong education. What are our thoughts on this categorisation? Is there any risk that using this separation could devalue âlearningâ as it could be potentially seen as ânon-educationâ?

My response: The distinction by Billet between lifelearning and lifelong education on an initial level seems quite correct. As noted, "we are all and have to be lifelong learners", which certainly seems to concur with most people's autodidactic activities and experiences. Indeed, something that perhaps could have been emphasied is that the necessity for lifelong learning is significantly greater in contemporary times with rates of technological change and accelerated cultural diversity.

The distinction is well recognised by other theorists of adult and lifelong learning, for example, Candy and Crebert:

"Nowadays, it is widely - if not universally - acknowledged that formal education occupies only a small proportion of the learning continuum, that most people complete their formal education early in their lives in a relatively short period, and that most learning experiences take place outside the educational institution."

However, it is more than the just the distinction that Billet is noting - a core proposition which comes from it is "tensions arising between the kinds of provisions that aimed to promote and support particular kinds of learning ... most likely to be strongest when key institutions intensity their efforst to control and regulate individual's learning". Billet combines the distinction with this issue "... the project of promoting and suipporting adults' lifelong learning and recommendation is cast through an educational institutional perspective that uses throughout an emphasis on educational practises and processed, rather than one focussed on learning, thereby misrepresenting lifelong learning and narrowing its purview and purposes".

Whilst Billet rightly questions whether the misalignment is intentional or unintentional, the key issue is that the confusion leads to education institutions "offering a systems approach to meet the needs of learners across the lifespan... [with] a return to models that haave been shown to be unhelpful..". Billet concludes ".. by only focussing on and having as a starting point as a provision of lifelong education, lifelong learning is being msrepresented, misinformed, and skewed".

What is being described here - and it's a little surprising that it's not directly referenced - is a classic example of the system-lifeworld distinction elaborated by Habermas. Lifelong learning is what people will do as members of a society in a cultural lifeworld which helps establish public opinion and personality. However that context also includes a social system which has institutionl aims and objectives and uses particular media (money and power). Cultural lifelong learning experiences are, through such media inclinations, becoming systematised, to the satisfaction of institutional needs.

In part there is some sense in systematisation of lifelong learning as lifelong education. It does provide an institutionalisation and formalisation of learning standards and content according to at least nominal democratic requirements; skills and knowledges that aid productivity, for instance, rather than becoming a historian of trivial urban legends (this is, obviously, an extreme example). Nevertheless, the systematic colonisation of lifeworld processes distorts the formation of cultural values and personalities, and as a result the production of meaning must remain, to a degree, independent of the system media.

SL commented:

So if I'm understanding what you're saying correctly Lev, the benefit or 'sense' of a degree of "systematisation of lifelong learning" is that it helps standardise content and learning "according to at least nominal democratic requirements; skills and knowledges that aid productivity"? I suppose that this implies that lifelong learning should be tied somewhat to societal (democratic?) needs. The challenging part of that for me is that my conception of lifelong learning is that is it is primarily a personal activity (though usually happening in a social context), hence why I found Billett's article so agreeable. In this way the lifeworld-system distinction you offer is helpful.

Revisiting the original question, Is there any risk that using this separation could devalue âlearningâ as it could be potentially seen as ânon-educationâ? one of the issues I observe is that those operating in the education system are not always so successful in engaging students where their learning is occurring. The more structure and inflexibility there is in the system, the less capable teachers and lecturers often are at recognising, understanding and responding to the learning that is happening and supporting that. Looking at it from the policy 'angle' as per this unit, policy outcomes and processes that put external demands on educators (types of standardised testing for example) often have the effect of reducing flexibility and have a negative impact on the learning that might happen.

My response:

Raising the matter of democracy is an interesting one; as some supportive critics of Habermas system/lifeworld model have pointed out system steering media is wealth and power, whereas markets and democracy represent particular implementations of those steering media which represent at least a partial implementation of a communicative interface between the system and the lifeworld. There is a tension between the two implementations of course, which re-emphases the need for democratic input in educational policy that is orientated towards those personal development aspects initiated from motivations in lifelong learning.

As you also mention the distinction between education and learning can and does lead towards the former unable to recognise that its very foundation is the latter. Lifelong education will simply not exist unless there is the need and motivation for lifelong learning. The practical implementation, as you mention, often comes with negative impacts on learning.

SL asked: 2/. The kind of environment (or labour market) that Olssen describes, where the individual worker needs to keep up-skilling to remain employable and to keep their tenure, to be flexible and to be able to be âmobileâ between departments or employers (or between nations) is something I experience working in the VET sector. But he argues that lifelong learning is enabling this âindividualisation of responsibility for educationâ and âdowngrading of social rightsâ. Do you see lifelong learning as a cause of this like Olssen, or instead do you see lifelong learning as a product of the economic environment, an effect, a solution, or something else?

My response: This is not an 'or' situation, but rather an iterative 'and' situation. Olssen's analysis, utilising the genealogical methodology of Foucault, looks at the interrelationships of sources of power in a fairly restricted manner; Foucault's "aim is not to ascertain the legitimacy of state power, or the management of states, but to understand the nature of government rationalities linked to specific technologies in terms of how collective power is exercised over individuals... for Foucault power is not an entity, but a relationship of forces".

This relationship of forces is evident in competing interests of the various participants and their context. In reference to lifelong learning (and especially lifelong education) this forces and their expression of power is fairly evident; the changing technological and social context means that employers want workers who are more productive, the workers want to have the skills and knowledges necessary for good wages and conditions, the government wants to see educational institutions that satisfy the objectives in a steering-performance way, and individuals - independent of these concerns - may simply wish to engage in lifelong learning in subjects of their own volition for its own sake.

Olssen take up this perspective in reviewing the application of lifelong learning in human capital theory. especially in regard to the German Ordoliberalism and American neoliberalism. This review does (as has been mentioned before) make the error that classical political economy was not concerned with labour productivity issues ("an active factor of production"), but more pertinently, claims that the 'technology' of lifelong learning 'enables both the individualisation of responsibility of education or learning, and on the other it enables the abolition of welfare obligations of states. In this sense, the technology of lifelong learning enable a downgrading of social rights".

This is, to use Popper's terminology, a "bold conjecture" and such claims require strong grounding, which not really provided. Instead an alternative vision of learning for democracy is offered which would include a "move away from a concern with quantitative addition of cognitive and metacognitive skills with qualitative transformation of the subject through their active engagement in the democratic process..." that "... embody and express principles that transcend the ation-state and the free development of all peoples". It would be interesting to consider the author's reaction to a result of 'active engagement' that came to the conclusion that 'cognitive and metacognitive skills' were actually desired and considered useful.

There is certainly a useful project from Foucault insofar that a mapping of power relationships would be worthwhile to illustrate the balance of forces and the subtle imposition of collective power structures on the individual in learning and educational choices, but the reading offered does not really initiate this path or the normative foundations. Indeed, it may be an issue with Foucault as a whole who, as mentioned, is ambiguous at best on questions concerning the legitimacy of power or its distribution. As Nancy Fraser cleverly put it Foucault offers "empirical insights and normative confusions".

The two major characteristics of adult learning that emerge out of this literatureâwhich are inspired by humanistic principlesârelate to (1) autonomy of direction in learning and (2) the importance of the use of personal experience as a learning resource.

Emerging Adulthood: Learning and Development During The First Stage of Adulthood

Summary

Tanner, Arnett, and Leis (2009) make the claim that there is a need for the "unique developmental features of discrete age periods", specifically "the need to recognize the age period between 29 [sic: 19] and 30 as a distinct development period, emerging adulthood". The theory of 'emerging adulthood' was proposed by Arnett, initially in 2000, "to identify a new and distinct period of the life course that came to define the experience of 18- to 29-year-olds in industrialized societies over the past half-century". Assigning development stages to social contexts, Arnett argues that 18-29 year olds can no longer be described as "young adults", as they are unmarried, without children, and are not in stable full-time work. Nor is it possible to describe them as "adolescents" as they are not going through puberty, they are not in secondary school, and they do not live in their parent's home.

The theory of emerging adulthood claims that period will be associated with "1) the age of identity explorations, 2) the age of instability, 3) the self-focussed age, 4) the age of feeling in-between, and 5) the age of possibilities". Identity exploration was previously associated with adolescence (Erikson, 1950) however Arnett (et al) now argue that although romantic love is typically experienced in that period, it becomes identity focussed in emerging adulthood. Likewise, whilst adolescents are often in part-time work, the work becomes more identity focussed in emerging adulthood, etc. Surveys suggest that emerging adults consider themselves subjectively adults "in some ways yes, in some ways no", suggesting a period of transition. Possibilities are considered high with the opportunity to leave pathogenic family environments with the "change in the parent-child relationship ... recognized as one of the most important markers in becoming an adult".

Arnett's "string of social transitions" is complemented by Tanner (2006) who presents a three-stage process of a development process of individual recentering from adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood, which "[b]y definition ... is marked by a weakening of institutional ties". The proponents claim that "developmental science has progressed in its understanding of emerging adulthood as a critical period for the evolution of adult cognitive structures", further noting "significant differences between the adolescent and emerging adult brains", particularly brain maturation. With brain maturation, "intelligence as a genetically pre-disposed component of cognitive functioning becomes less salient during emerging adulthood and settled in experience becomes more salient", the claim of salience also repeated for emotional intelligence, concluding when "adulthood is achieved as a function of consolidation of identity around commitments to careers and families", albeit with a period of emerging adulthood representing a high-risk for psychiatric disorder. In terms of informal social networks, the authors do acknowledge however that emerging adults have similar friendships, with existing gender differences continuing. The chief exception appears to be a higher than average subjective claim of family members as close friends, correlating with the establishment of individual independence.

Despite initial implications of universality, the authors suggest that "[e]merging adulthood is culturally bound existing 'in contemporary industrialized cultures that extend the transition to adulthood until the mid- to late twenties'", especially with the "American college experience and college environment are well-suited to the development features of emerging adulthood". In such societies "[t]he boundary between childhood an adulthood is not as sharp as it used to be", with emerging adulthood bridging a supposed gap between to the two stages. For the authors, the implication of such a developmental stage is an opportunity for "tapping into their unique motivations for learning and development", noting "an openness to experience, an eagerness to try new things, and a willingness to learn".

Critique

The article by Tanner et.al., provides a compiled wealth of contemporary empirical references, but suffers for a want of epistemological rigour and clarity in interpretation. The initial concerns of how the proposal of "emerging adulthood" is initially implied as a developmental category, then redefined as culturally bound is an early example of this problem which the authors themselves noticed. Developmental psychology, of course, has historically sought universal features that can associate mental states with biological development. As Burns (1995) points out "The biological definition of would argue that adulthood commences when the individual can reproduce", and notes that legal categories for an age of majority, at least in modern societies, occur at various points after this biological minimum. The debates over these legal categories are, of course, informed by developmental psychology, specifically "Piaget on cognitive development, Freud on psychosexual development, Kohlberg on moral development, and Erikson on psychosocial development". One may add Mead's symbolic interactions as another contribution which also correlates to the aforementioned developmental structures (Mead, 1934). It is very significant that, with the exception of the most socially relativistic contribution (i.e., Erikson) Tanner et.al., do not refer to the sequential categories well-established by developmental psychology.

To represent a genuinely new developmental stage, rather than a deviation that will generate social pathologies (something which Tanner et. al., note a significant without explanation), new developmental features have to be illustrated. In the field of cognitive structures, there is a clear path from sensorimotor cognition, to the preoperational, concrete operational, to formal operations from adolescence onwards. Likewise in moral development, from (again) the sensorimotor, to preconventional, conventional, to post-conventional moral reasoning, in psychosexual development from instinct, to the id, ego, and superego, and in interactions from the instinctual to play, games, and the adoption of roles. Where Tanner et. al., use psychosocial categories they acknowledge their relativism, but these must be perceived as categories that must co-exist with those illustrated by development psychology. If this is not done, then nonsensical results can occur; a child could be legally disinstituted, and then be classified as an "emerging adult", regardless of cognitive development; an mature adult could reject the need for a stable family or career life, and therefore remain supposedly trapped within adolescence, regardless of their reasons for doing so (Piaget and Kohlberg, for example, were always less concerns with the content of an answer, but more so with the reasons provided).

Tanner et.al., do illustrate the significance of brain maturation and cognitive stability. As significant at these are these are not however new categories themselves. As such, there is no new developmental category of "emerging adulthood", but rather a useful illustration of the gradual biological extension of young adulthood through the maturation process and where cognitive reasoning is part of that process. This should certainly be recognisable in education; contrary to Tanner et.al., many adolescents are certainly capable of being subject to the key concepts of the andragogical model, as illustrated by Burns, without or without institutional independence, but only after the acquisition of the capacity for formal operations, post-conventional moral reasoning, etc. What is quite interesting the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the so-called "emerging adulthood" age. This, at least from a perspective of critical sociology, suggests that there is a misalignment in the societies studied between the cognitive development and social integration. That certainly is an area requiring further research.

    "The authors in the first piece suggested that there is research were individuals were asked to reflect on a moment that helped define their identity. Most indicate the event took place during "emerging adulthood" (EA).

    If you feel comfortable, would you share a defining event in your life that helped you better understand "who you are?" Also, please comment if this did or did not happen during EA" 

Reviewing the earlier post "Who Are You?" and considering those changes I would have to claim that 'who I am', in terms of substantive content, is a matter of continuous transition that most certainly cannot be narrowed down to a single developmental age group, real or imagined.

If I try to abstract it however into an interest in computational science, and an involvement in libertarian socialist politics, and an interest in the aesthetic of mythologies - which really has dominated my entire adult life experience and therefore must be considered major components of my identity - I must acknowledge that these came to the be in my early adolescence, around 12-13 in all three cases.

It is not a case of a single particular event (although there were events that correlate), but rather - in hindsight - the apparent ability to look at such matters with a different cognitive manner which simply didn't exist in childhood.
Introduction: Lifelong Learning

The idea of leaving school, studying or training for a particular career or job, and then remaining in that job for life, no longer holds true. The changing nature of the workplace, including widespread implementation of computerised systems, means that job descriptions are being continuously redefined. Increased opportunities for travel and leisure have led to a more mobile workforce with the time to develop recreational interests.

With changes such as these, there is increasing acknowledgment that education and training are not the exclusive province of school children and school leavers. Instead, it is generally accepted that learning is a lifelong process:

"Nowadays, it is widelyâif not universallyâacknowledged that formal education occupies only a small proportion of the learning continuum, that most people complete their formal education early in their lives in a relatively short period, and that most learning experiences take place outside the educational institution." Candy & Crebert (1990, pp 65â77)

The last pair of readings (Candy, Crebert, & OâLeary, 1994) for this topic stresses the importance of developing lifelong learners. The optional reading (Gonczi, 2004) also addresses the issue of lifelong learning and a learning society but in the context of vocational and professional education. The author is highly critical of reductionist approaches to competency-based education. He makes a case for the value of holistic, work-based learning opportunities that bring together the general and the vocational, the generic and the specific. Based on situated-learning theoretical perspectives, the author recommends that universities consider apprenticeship models for undergraduate education and postgraduate work-based learning degrees.
Short Answers

Lifelong learning is the interest. motivation, and increasingly the necessity, of the knowledge acquisition and reflection.

It is contextually relevant for adult learners who already have reached a level of education. It may occur in a formal, semi-formal, informal, or even autodidact setting.

"(1) What differencesâif anyâdo you see between adult learners and children learners?"

Whilst the differences between adult and child learners exist on a continuum and vary according to individuals concerned, some aggregate remarks can made, most of which can be discerned from the readings by Burns and Knowles et. al. In summary;

* Adults are usually in a voluntary learning environment, whereas children must attend school.
* Adult learning tends more towards self-motivated and independent learning with a greater range of experiental resources.
* Adult learning tends increasingly towards a research orientation rather than a teaching-training orientation.

The reasons for this change include chronological opportunities for life experience and development of social networks, the acquisition of legal rights, and neurological changes. The main ramifications is the need for educators to provide a learning environment that is more orientated to a greater level of equality between learner and educator, the opportunity to express knowledge from life experiences, and the flexibility to engage in study directions suited to their own practical tasks and interests.

As an adult learner in a variety of settings (formal, informal, personal) this matches with my own experience.

"(2) Why is LLL valuable in your life or in your studentsâ lives?"

As adult learner motivations vary the value of LLL will also vary. As an example, derived from the Burn's article, for some, it is a matter of a pure love of learning for its own sake. For others it about establishing social networks in an area of mutual interest. For other still, it is a necessary (and perhaps even unwelcome!) response to the rate of change on the vocational environment. In most cases the value will be a combination of all three.

    Please think of 3-5 non-traditional places where adult learning happens. Share these with your classmates.

Places where non-traditional adult learning can occur (assuming "traditional" means the university and other higher education setting) includes:

- Various online sources and specialist social media, but only those who make a serious effort to check primary sources, etc. Wikipedia, for example, as a starting point by following the references it uses. Google scholar is quite good as well.

- At work, through experience and discussion with colleagues.

- Conferences and meetings of organisations I'm involved in and casual conversation with friends; again however caution is expressed. Much of what people say in casual conversation needs to be checked. Conference presentations, at least of the more scholarly variety, tend to be somewhat better researched.

    Share your thoughts about the message being conveyed. Here are a few guiding questions:
    (1) What is the message?
    (2) Is this good or bad?
    (3) What are the assumptions about the current state of education and the proposed âfixâ?
    (4) What do students need to be able to succeed in the proposed environment? 

(1) What is the message?

The message is new and flexible approach to online education is more adaptable to unique student requirements.

(2) Is this good or bad?

The suggestion of greater flexibility and student control over their time and content is particularly beneficial in an increasingly asynchronous and unstructured social environment (whether that is a good thing is another matter entirely).

In terms of the learning presentation, it is not really something that can be determined from the material provided. Online education can and does work (speaking from someone who has completed "a few" post-graduate qualifications from online institutions), but it really does depend on the quality of the tools provided, the community, the individual learner, and the subject matter.

(3) What are the assumptions about the current state of education and the proposed âfixâ?

The assumption is the that most traditional education systems are rigid, especially in terms of functional needs (spatial proximity, timetables, etc); there is an implicit suggestion that traditional education methods are old-fashioned and the people who use them are herd-like.

(4) What do students need to be able to succeed in the proposed environment?

Data access technologies are a necessary requirement. Relevant skills at operating such technologies will also prove advantageous. Assuming technologies and skills, time management, motivation and interest of the student will be deciding factors.

    One of the activities in the internal session was to reflect on a good or bad teacher/teaching experience. Setting yourself in the role of supervisor, what type of evaluation would you write for this person, and how would you draw on the theories of the readings for Topic 1 to support your conclusions? 

As an overall statement, deriving from Burns (1995), an adult educator must relate to their students on a more equal basis. Where this is not the case Burns makes a point that "where responsibility is withheld, and where learners must fit into the structure ... [i]t is hardly surprising that adults approach formal settings with diffidence, low confidence and feelings of inferiority".

Following the recommendations of adult educational theory (andragogy), it is essential to differentiate the teaching methods from childhood educational theory (pedagogy), with the emphasis of the gradual introduction of adult teaching styles to those who have reached the appropriate level of cognitive maturity, operational ability, and moral reasoning.

In the particular example being considered greater attention can made towards the desire for adult learners to derive resources from their own experiences and that of their social network rather than the revealed knowledge of the educator, to present a focus on particular problems rather than a subject and prescribed curriculum, and to establish motivation from perfomance success rather than external critera (Burns op cit, p239).

The subject matter involves the introduction of new, disruptive, technologies into the workplace. Given the high level of unpredictability to an environment, course material can be more orientated towards the proposals for lifelong learning (Candy et al., 1994) and especially the need for lifelong learning for all adults. In the particular context it would have also been extremely useful to encourage collaborative workplace-based education (Gonczi, 2004).

    I am always curious what phrases catch people's attention.

    These two phrases caught my eye:

    Burns, pg 237 "as the new meanings and knowledge are digested into existing knowledge" -- a great metaphor for the influence of past experience on the assimilation of new information

    Gonczi, pg 27 "the mind as a holistic pattern detector" -- a great metaphor for the innate skills all students bring to the learning process...and, too often, a skill that is overlooked in the curriculum planning process.

    Please share any quotes from the readings that "spoke" to you as an adult educator and/or lifelong learner. 

Whilst I could find numerous references to the quote from Ãmile, when I actually checked the text (available in full at: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5427) it simply doesn't exist. Of course, it's scattered "all over the Internet", but at least Wikiquote notes that the attribution is, in fact, unsourced. (I do admit to a somewhat passionate distaste for false, misleading, and otherwise incorrect attributions. I have ranted about such things elsewhere c.f., http://lightbringers.net/node/16)

If we pretend however that Rousseau did make such a remark, and that he did so in Ãmile, there is another glaring difference between that quote and the reference to Knowles by Burns: Rousseau wrote Ãmile specifically for childhood education whereas the Knowles reference refers to adult education. It is not until Book V (Book VI is reserved for the education of girls and young women) that Ãmile enters his adolescent years and taught of the complexity of human emotions, is socialised - and is taught (for the first time) about religion.

Retaining the pretence, it makes great sense that Rousseau argues that the teacher retains control, whilst allows for the appearance of freedom. For it allows the child to learn through exploration, whilst retaining safe boundaries. They are effectively being *taught* freedom. Likewise, in reference to Knowles, it makes sense in an adult education environment that formal control is retained by the educator, even if they express this through informal techniques - as the students already have the responsibility of freedom. In both cases the activities are beneficial to the student.

Just a few semi-random thoughts on reading the STP:

* I am uncertain whether the experiences of "emerging adults" are integrated into "identities and memories more so than in any other age". There would be a few methodological issues with testing this to begin with!

* The challenge between adults as self-directing agents, and framing curriculum to their diverse interests is a very real one. In the Software Carpentry model (http://software-carpentry.org/) there is a deliberate attempt to bring people in from similar disciplines to encourage common interest, application, and collaboration.

* Learning style preferences can be accommodated through diversity in teaching presentation, class activities, and multimedia. This may result in repeating content, but certainly from the paper by Biggs (1986) on "Confucian-heritage learning culture", that repetition does not equate with rote-learning.

* The example of a student learning scales, some of which they have ability, and other where do not, is interesting in illustrating how emphasizing the former can be used for confidence building, and gradually introducing the latter provides scaffolding.
